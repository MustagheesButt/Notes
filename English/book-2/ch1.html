<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>4.</span> What are planets and how did they come into existence?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Planets are heavenly bodies constantly revolving around a star of which once they were a part of. The planets came into existence when a wandering star came near our sun. Due to gravitational pull of this star, a mountain was formed on the surface of the sun and it broke into pieces. These pieces started to revolve around the sun and are called planets.</h4>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>8.</span> What should be the conditions necessary for the kind of life we know to exist on other heavenly bodies? Do such conditions generally exist?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Life needs suitable physical conditions for its existence. The most important one is the temperature at which substances can exist in liquid state, but these conditions do not exist anywhere in space except Earth.</h4>
