    <h3 class="statement"><span>15.1</span> Does the induced emf in a circuit depend on the resistance of the circuit? Does the induced current depend on the resistance of the circuit?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<ol type='a'>
			<li>According to Faraday's law, <strong>&Epsilon; = -N&Delta;&Phi;/&Delta;t</strong>, so induced emf depends on rate of change of magnetic flux &Delta;&Phi, and it <strong>does not</strong> depends on resistance R of the circuit</li>
			<li>As I = E/R, so induced current is inversely proportional to resistance R.</li>

    <h4 class="answer">There will be no induced emf produced in the loop, as:
		<ul>
			<li>&Epsilon; = -N&Delta;&Phi;/&Delta;t</li>
			<li>here &Delta;&Phi;/&Delta;t = 0, as rate of change of flux is zero(normal of loop is parallel to magnetic field B). So,</li>

		</ul>
		Therefore, no emf is induced.

    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>According to Lenz's law, <em>"Induced current in a conductor is such that, it opposes the cause which produces it"</em>. Therefore, when magnetic flux changes in the magnetic ring, an emf is induced and north pole is developed in the ring <strong>towards the bar magnet</strong>.</p>

			<li>When switch S is closed, magnetic flux changes in second coil and current is induced in it. The current in second coil flows in anti-clockwise direction.</li>

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>15.5</span> Does the induced emf always act to decrease the magnetic flux through a circuit?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>No. According to Lenz's law, if magnetic flux increases then induced emf will act to decrease the magnetic flux. If magnetic flux decreases then the induced emf will act to increase magnetic flux.</p>
		<p>Therefore, induced emf does not always acts to decrease magnetic flux.</p>

    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>When switch is closed, the current is setup in the coil. Magnetic flux changes through metallic ring and an induced emf is produced in it.</p>
		<p>The face of the ring opposite to coil develops similar poles and experiences repulsion from the sides of coil which makes the ring jump.</p>

    <h4 class="answer">An emf and current in the coil is generated when it is rotated along x-axis. No change of flux takes place along y-axis and z-axis, because the coil is parallel to the magnetic field <strong>B</strong> all the time.</h4>

    <h4 class="answer">As the plane is moving towards north, in a region where magnetic field is vertically down, if all the fingers of right hand are stretched down keeping the thumb erect along the motion of plane (North) then the direction of palm of the right hand will indicate the magnetic force on positive charges towards west. Therefore, positive charges in the body of the plane move towards west wingtip, making it positively charged.</h4>

		<p>The unit of emf (E) is volt, which is given as:

		<p>Unit of &Delta;&Phi;/&Delta;t is webber/s, which can be written as:
			$$ \frac{ Web }{ s } = \frac{ Tesla.m^{2} }{ s } = \frac{ NA^{-1}m^{-1} . m^{2} }{ s } = \frac{ Nm }{ As } = \frac{ J }{ C } $$

    <h3 class="statement"><span>15.11</span> When an electric motor, such as an electric drill, is being used, does it also act as a generator? If so, what is the consequence of this?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">When a motor like drill machine is working, its armature (coil) is revolving in a uniform magnetic field by a potential difference V. The revolving armature of the motor experiences change in flux, which produces emf, known as back emf of the motor. Hence, a drill machine (or a motor) is also operating like a generator whose generated emf is known as <strong>back emf</strong>.</h4>

    <h4 class="answer">A D.C. motor can be converted into a D.C. generator. For this, the armature coil of the motor is to be coupled with some rotating body. The rotational motion of the body is transferred to the armature coil of the motor. Due to its rotation, the magnetic flux through the coil changes and an emf is induced at the output. The motor, therefore, becomes a generator.</h4>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>15.15</span> A suspended magnet is oscillating freely in a horizontal plane. The oscillations are strongly damped when a metal plate is placed under the magnet. Explain why this occurs?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Due to the oscillations of the magnet, the magnetic flux passing through the metallic plate changes. This produces an induced emf in the plate and hence an induced current. The induced current produces its own magnetic field which always opposes the motion of the bar magnet. Therefore, the oscillatory motion of the bar magnet is damped.</h4>

			<li>No. A step-up transformer can only increase the voltage level at its secondary. It cannot increase the power level in the light of law of conservation of energy.</li>

		<ol type="a">
			<li>If the secondary output is open, the output power (V<sub>s</sub>I<sub>s</sub>) will be zero.
