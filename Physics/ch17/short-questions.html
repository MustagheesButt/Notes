<div class="question important">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>17.2</span> Define stress and strain. What are their SI units? Differentiate between tensile, compressive and shear modes of stress and strain.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Stress</strong>: It is defined as the force applied on unit area to produce any change in shape, volume, or length of a body. Mathematically, if <strong>F</strong> is the force applied on area <strong>A</strong>, then stress can be expressed as:<div class="center">Stress = Force/Area = F/A</div>Unit of stress is <strong>Nm</strong> (newton meter) or <strong>P</strong> (pascal).</li>
			<li><strong>Strain</strong>: It is defined as the fractional change in length, volume or shape of a body when stress is applied on it. It has no unit.</li>
			<li><strong>Tensile Stress</strong>: When a stress changes length it is called tensile stress.</li>
			<li><strong>Tensile Strain</strong>: It is defined as the fractional change in length on applying stress.</li>
			<li><strong>Compressive Stress</strong>: The stress which causes change in volume of the body is called compressive stress.</li>
			<li><strong>Compressive Strain</strong>: This is the strain produced as a result of compressive stress.</li>
			<li><strong>Shear Stress</strong>: The stress tending to produce an angular deformation or change in the shape is called shear stress.</li>
			<li><strong>Shear Strain</strong>: This is the strain caused by angular deformation. It is equal to the angular displacement produced.</li>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>17.3</span> Define modulus of elasticity. Show that the units of modulus of elasticity and stress are the same. Also discuss its three kinds.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p><strong>Modulus of Elasticity (E)</strong> is defined as the ratio of the stress on a body to the strain produced. It has 3 types.
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Young's modulus</strong> is the ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain.</li>
			<li><strong>Bulk modulus</strong> is the ratio of volume stress to volume strain.</li>
			<li><strong>Shear modulus</strong> is the ratio of shear stress to shear strain of a body.</li>
		</ol>
		The unit of Modulus of elasticity is the same as stress since strain has no units, i.e. E = stress/strain = Nm<sup>-2/(no units) = Nm<sup>-2</sup>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Elastic Limit</strong>: It is defined as the maximum stress a material can endure without any permanent change in its shape or dimension.</li>
			<li><strong>Yield Point</strong>: The point at which the material begins to ‘flow’, i.e. the strain increases with time up to breaking point without further increase in the stress.</li>
			<li><strong>Ultimate Tensile Stress</strong>: It is defined as the maximum stress a material can withstand and can be regarded as the nominal strength of the material.</li>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>17.5</span> What is meant by strain energy? How can it be determined from the force-extension graph?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>The amount of P.E. stored in a material due to displacing of its molecule from their mean position is called strain energy.</p>
		<p>In a force-extension graph, strain energy can be calculated by the formula:

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>17.6</span> Describe the formation of energy bands in solids. Explain the difference among electrical behaviour of conductors, insulators and semi-conductors in terms of energy band theory.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>Electrons of an isolated atom are bound to the nucleus and can have distinct energy levels. However when a large number of atoms, say N, are brought close to one another to form a solid, each energy level of the isolated atom splits into N sub-levels, called states, under the action of the forces exerted by other atoms in the solid. These permissible energy states are discrete but so closely spaced that they appear to form a continuous energy band. In between two permissible energy bands, there is range of energy states which cannot be occupied by electrons. These are called forbidden energy states and its range is said to be forbidden energy gap.</p>
		<ol type="i">
			<li><strong>Conductors</strong> are those substances which have plenty of free electrons for electrical conduction. In conductors, valence and conduction bands largely overlap each other. There is no physical distinction between the two bands which ensures the availability of a large number of free electrons due to overlapping of conduction and valence energy bands.</li>
			<li><strong>Insulators</strong> are those substances in which valence electrons are tightly bound to their atoms and are not free to move. An insulator has an empty conduction band, a full valence band and a large energy gap in between them.</li>
			<li><strong>Semi-conductors</strong> at room temperature are partially filled conduction band, partially filled valence band and very narrow forbidden gap between valence and conduction band.</li>

<div class="question important">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>17.7</span> Distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic semi-conductors. How would you obtain n-type and p-type material from pure silicon? Illustrate it by schematic diagram.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p><strong>Intrinsic semi-conductors</strong> is also known as a pure semi-conductor, i.e. without any other element's atoms mixed/doped in it. It has same number of electrons and holes.</p>
		<p><strong>Extrinsic semi-conductors</strong> are impure semi-conductors, i.e. doped/mixed with certain impurities(atoms of other elements). Its conductivity increases considerably depending on the type and concentration of the impurity.</p>
		<p><strong>P-type</strong> materials are obtained by doping semi-conductor with atoms of a trivalent impurity such as Boron. It creates a vacancy of an electron called a hole.</p>
		<p><strong>N-type</strong> materials are obtained by doping semi-conductor with atoms of a pentavalent impurity such as Phosphorous. It leaves a free electron.</p>

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>17.8</span> Discuss the mechanism of electrical conduction by holes and electrons in a pure semi-conductor element.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">In a pure (or intrinsic) semi-conductor, the number of holes and free electrons is equal and both contribute to the flow of current through it. When voltage is applied across the semi-conductor, an electric field is produced. Due to this electric field, electrons get a drift velocity opposite to the electric field and holes in the direction of the electric field. Therefore, a flow of current is established in the semi-conductor.</h4>

<div class="question important">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>17.9</span> Write a note on superconductors.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Materials whose resistivity becomes zero at a certain temperature are known as superconductors. Once the resistance of a material drops to zero, no energy is dissipated and the current once established, continues to exist indefinitely without the source of emf. The temperature at which resistivity becomes zero is called critical temperature. For example, Mercury (Hg) T = 4.2 K, Aluminium (Al) T =1.18 K. The first superconductor was discovered in 1911 by Kamerlingh Onnes. He observed that electrical resistance of Mercury disappears at 4.2 K. Some other metals such as Al, Sn and Pb also became superconductors at very low temperatures. In 1986, a new class of ceramic materials was discovered that became superconductor at 125 K. Recently Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) have been reported to become superconductor at 163 K. Superconductors have many applications, e.g. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), magnetic levitation trains and computer chips.</h4>
