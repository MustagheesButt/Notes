<div class="question important">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.2</span> Why are heavy nuclei unstable?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>Heavy nuclei are unstable because of the repulsive electromagnetic forces between protons. Since heavy nuclei, such as Uranium, have a large number of protons and neutrons, these repulsive forces overcome the strong force of attraction which binds together the protons and neutrons in the nucleus, which makes the nuclei unstable.</p>
		<p>An unstable nuclei tries to achieve stability by giving off a neutron or proton in a process called radioactive decay.</p>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.3</span> If a nucleus has a half-life of 1 year, does this mean that it will be completely decayed after 2 years? Explain.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>No, it does not mean that after 2 years it will be completely decayed.</p>
		<strong>Reason:</strong>
		<p>If a nucleus has a half-life of 1 year, it means that after 1 year only half of the original number of atoms will remain. So after 2 years, 1/4<sup>th</sup>(one-fourth) of the original number of atoms (N) will remain.</p>

    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>3/4 or 75% of the original sample is decayed after two half-lives.</p>
		<p>Suppose N is the number of atoms in the radioactive sample. So after one half-life has passed, 1/2 of the original atoms (N) will be decayed. And after two half-lives have passed, 1/4 of the original atoms will be decayed. So the total number of decayed atoms will be:

				<li>N/2 + N/4 = N3/4 or 75% of N.</li>

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.6</span> Describe a brief account of interaction of various types of radiations with matter.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p><strong>&alpha;-particles</strong> can ionize and excite atoms of the element through which they pass. The ionization caused by &alpha;-particles may be due to direct elastic collision with atoms or due to electrostatic attraction between them and the electrons of the atoms. This property of ionization is used to detect and measure the energy of &alpha;-particles. For example, an &alpha;-particle creates about 10<sup>4</sup> ionization in 1 mm of air.</p>
		
		<p><strong>&beta;-particles</strong> are fast moving electrons coming out of nuclei of radioactive elements. &beta;-particles are 7000 times lighter than &alpha;-particles and their charge is half of the charge on an &alpha;-particle. Ionization caused by &beta;-particles is due to electrostatic repulsion between them and electrons of the atom. Ionizing ability of &beta;-particles is about 100 times less than that of &alpha;-particles because their mass and charge is smaller than an &alpha;-particle's mass and charge. However, their range through gas is about 100 times more than &alpha;-particles. Their path is not straight due to deflection caused by collisions with atoms of the medium.</p>

		<p><strong>&gamma;-rays</strong> are uncharged radiations coming out of the nuclei of radioactive elements. The ionization caused by &gamma;-ray photons is almost negligible. &gamma;-rays interact with matter in three different ways depending on their energy:
			<ul>
				<li>At low energy, less than 0.5 MeV, &gamma;-rays interact with matter and produce photoelectric effect.</li>
				<li>At intermediate energy, between 0.5-1.0 MeV, &gamma;-rays produce Compton scattering.</li>
				<li>At energy higher than 1.02 MeV, the dominant process is pair production.</li>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.7</span> Explain how &alpha; and &beta;-particles may ionize an atom without directly hitting the electrons? What is the difference in the action of the two particles for producing ionization?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">&alpha; and &beta;-particles may ionize an atom without directly hitting the electrons as &alpha;-particles are positively charged and &beta;-particles are negatively charged. When an &alpha;-particle passes by an atom, it attracts its electrons and the atom is ionized. On the other hand, when a &beta;-particle passes by an atom it repels the electrons of the atom and may knock it out, which will ionize the atom.</h4>

<div class="question important">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.8</span> A particle which produces more ionization is less penetrating. Why?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">The kinetic energy of the particles which produce more ionization is used up quickly in the process, therefore, they have less penetration power. On the other hand, the particles with low ionizing power can travel greater distances in a medium because they have more kinetic energy left.</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>The &alpha;-particles leave thick, straight and continuous tracks due to intense ionization produced by them.</li>
			<li>The &beta;-particles form thin and discontinuous tracks in an irregular manner showing frequent deflections.</li>

    <h4 class="answer">Since &alpha;-particle posses less penetrating power than gamma rays, therefore, a thin window allows their entry into Geiger tube easily. For detecting &gamma;-rays, window becomes useless because of their high penetrating power. Therefore, G&dash;M tube does not need a window for detection of gamma rays.</h4>
