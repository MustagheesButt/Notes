    <h3 class="statement"><span>14.1</span> A plane conducting loop is located in a uniform magnetic field that is directed along the x-axis. For what orientation of the loop is the flux maximum? For what orientation is the flux minimum?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<ol type="i">
			<li><strong>Maximum Flux</strong>:
				<p>When a conducting loop is held perpendicular to the magnetic field, i.e. vector area is parallel to magnetic field, then &theta; = 0&deg;. So, &Phi; = BA cos&theta; = BA cos0&deg; = BA</p>
				<p>So flux will be maximum when plane of conducting loop is perpendicular to magnetic field.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Minimum Flux</strong>:
				<p>When a conducting loop is held parallel to the magnetic field, i.e. vector area is perpendicular to magnetic field, then &theta; = 90&deg;. So, &Phi; = BA cos&theta; = BA cos90&deg; = 0</p>
				<p>So flux will be minimum when plane of conducting loop is parallel to magnetic field.</p>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>14.2</span> A current in a conductor produces a magnetic field, which can be calculated using Ampere's law.

    <h4 class="answer">A stationary charge cannot produce any magnetic field but it can produce electric field. Whereas, a moving charge can produce a magnetic field around the path of its motion similar to a current carrying conductor's magnetic field.</h4>

    		<li>the number of turns is doubled, but the length remains the same.</li>

    </h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Magnetic field produced by a solenoid is given by:
		<ul>
			<li>B = &micro;<sub>o</sub>nI</li>
			<li>B = &micro;NI/L (&because; n = N/L)</li>
		</ul>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Let B&prime; be the magnetic field when the length of solenoid is doubled, i.e. L&prime; = 2L and the number of turns remain same. Then,
				<ul>
					<li>B&prime; = &micro;<sub>o</sub>NI/2L = 1/2 x &micro;<sub>o</sub>NI/L</li>
					<li>B&prime; = 1/2 x B (&because; B = &micro;<sub>o</sub>NI/L)</li>
				</ul>
			Therefore, the magnetic field becomes half if the length of solenoid is doubled but the number of turns remain same.

			<li>Let B&prime; be the magnetic field when the number of turns is doubled, i.e. N&prime; = 2N and the length remains same. Then,

					<li>B&prime; = 2B (&because; B = &micro;<sub>o</sub>NI/L)</li>

			Therefore, the magnetic field becomes double if the number of turns in solenoid is doubled but the length remains same.

		<p>According to right hand rule, the direction of magnetic force will be along y-axis. Because F = e(V x B).</p>

    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>When the charged particles are projected across a magnetic field, they experience a force. This magnetic force on the charged particles tends to deflect them into a curved path.</p>
		<p>If the charged particles are deflected opposite to each other, then the particles have opposite charges. So if one particle is positively charged, the other must be negatively charged.</p>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>14.6</span> Suppose that a charge q is moving in a uniform magnetic field with a velocity v. Why is there no work done by the magnetic force that acts on the charge q?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">The magnetic force on the charge q is given by:
		<ul><li>F<sub>m</sub> = q(V x B)</li></ul>
		Due to the magnetic force, the charge will move in a circular path. In the circular path, the force F<sub>m</sub> is perpendicular to the velocity v.
		<ul>
			<li>W = F.d</li>
			<li>W = Fd cos&theta;</li>
			<li>W = Fd cos90&deg; = 0 (&because; &theta; = 90&deg;)</li>
		</ul>
		So there is no work done by the magnetic force that acts on the charge q. Hence, the magnetic force acts only as a deflecting force.

		<ol type="i">
			<li>Yes. The charged particle moves in a straight line if there is no magnetic field in the region.</li>
			<li>
				No. Because the charged particle may be moving parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field. So &theta; = 0&deg; or &theta; = 180&deg; &Implies; F = qvB sin&theta; = 0. Since there is no magnetic field acting on the charged particle(although the magnetic field exists), it will move in a straight line.

    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>Yes it is possible. A current carrying loop when placed in a magnetic field experiences a torque, i.e. &tau; = BINA cos&alpha;</p>
		<p>Where &alpha; is the angle between magnetic field B and plane of the loop. When the plane of the loop is at right angle to the magnetic field, i.e. &alpha; = 90&deg;. So &tau; = BINA cos90&deg; = 0. As the value of the torque is zero so the loop will not tend to rotate.

    <h4 class="answer">When a current carrying loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field, at different orientations, a torque is produced in the loop. So if we place the loop in the given region and it gets deflected, then we can say that a magnetic field is present because a torque was produced. If it does not gets deflected, then no magnetic field is present.</h4>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>14.11</span> How can you use a magnetic field to separate isotopes of chemical element?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">The isotopes of an element are projected perpendicular to the uniform magnetic field. Then different isotopes follow different paths due to the difference in their masses. This technique is called Mass spectrometry. As,
	<ul>
		<li>e/m = v/rB</li>
		<li>r = mv/eB</li>
		<li>As v/eB is constant, r &propto; m</li>
	</ul>
	Therefore, isotopes of different masses will have different radii of their circular paths. Hence, they can be separated by a magnetic field.
