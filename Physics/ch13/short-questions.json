Therefore, if potential difference is increased then the drift velocity of free electrons is also increased.</li><li>decreasing the length and the temperature of the wire: As the resistance depends on temperature and length of the conductor, so on decreasing the temprature and length of the conductors, the resistance decreases and, therefore, drift velocity increases.</li></ol>",

	"statement": "Why does the resistance of a conductor rise with temperature?",
	"answer": "The resistance offered by a conductor is due to the collisions of electrons with the atoms of lattice. As temprature rises, K.E. of the atoms increases and, hence, more collisions with the electrons occur, thereby increasing the resistance of the conductor.",

	"statement": "What are the difficulties in testing whether the filament of a lighted bulb obeys Ohm's law?",
	"answer": "According to ohm's law, current is directly proportional to applied potential difference provided that the temprature of conductor must remain constant. Therefore, after some time has passed while current is flowing through the lighted bulb, the temprature rises and hence Ohm's law becomes invalid.",

	"answer": "As the relation between terminal potential difference and emf is:<ul><li>V<sub>t</sub> = E - Ir</li></ul>Here r is the internal resistance of the cell.
