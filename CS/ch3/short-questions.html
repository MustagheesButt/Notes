<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>1.</span> Define relationship with an example.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">
		<p>A logical connection between different entities is called a relationship.</p>
		<p>For example, a relationship exists between a Student and Teacher because Teacher <em>teaches</em> Student.</p>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>2.</span> What is one-to-one relationship? Give an example.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">One-to-one cardinality means that one instance of entity A is related to only one instance of entity B. For example, Chairman runs a Department. The department can have only one chairman, and a chairman can be the chairman of only one department.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>3.</span> What is cardinality of a relation?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">The number of instances of one entity that can be associated with each instance of another related entity is known as cardinality of relationship. The cardinality is expressed as one or many. For example, a Country can have only one Capital, and a Mother can have many Children.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>4.</span> List different types of relationships.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">
		The different types of relationship are:
		<ul>
			<li>One-to-one.</li>
			<li>One-to-many.</li>
			<li>Many-to-many.</li>
			<li>Recursive.</li>
		</ul>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>5.</span> State the purpose of database design process.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">The main objective of database design is to map the conceptual data model to an implementation model. A particular DBMS must be able to process this model.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>6.</span> What are the objectives of physical database design?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Physical design is the last stage of database design process. The main objective is to implement the database as a set of records, files, indexes and other data structures.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>7.</span> What is the logical database design?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">The logical or conceptual model describes the data stored in the database. It contains the complete definition and details of the data to be stored in database. It also contains the rules and information about the structure and type of data.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>8.</span> What is data modeling?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">When we want to prepare a database system the important thing is data. That data is required to fulfill the requirements. Data modeling is a way to represent required data. So the identification or representation of various data objects, events and the association or relationship between them is called data modeling. There are different data models such as ER Diagram.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>9.</span> Define modality.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Modality describes relationships as either mandatory or optional. It specifies absolute minimum number of relationships. The relationship is called optional if minimum number of required relations are zero. And it is mandatory if the minimum number is one.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>10.</span> What is meant by the term "Analysis"?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">A process of studying the existing system is known as analysis. The basic purpose of analysis is to know which activities are performed in the current system. The analysis also determines what should take place in the new system.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>11.</span> What are the activities involved in data analysis?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Data analysis involves the activities of making Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), Decision Tables and Decision Trees.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>12.</span> What are the ingredients of data modeling?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">
		A data model consists of different elements or objects that are used to represent the data items. These objects are known as ingredients. Some of them are:
		<ol>
			<li>Entities</li>
			<li>Attributes</li>
			<li>Relationships</li>
		</ol>
	</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>13.</span> What is the concept of data distribution strategy?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Many organizations today have distributed computing networks. For these organizations, a significant problem is physical database design, which is to decide at which locations (sites) in the network to store the data.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>14.</span> What is an ER diagram? Why is it used?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">
		<p>An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a symbolic representation of entities and their relationships in a database. ER diagrams use different symbols to represent different information of a database system.</p>
		<p>ER diagrams are used to analyze existing databases to find and resolve problems in logic or deployment. ER diagrams make it easy to design and find problems in the design of databases.</p>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>15.</span> What is project planning?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">After requirements analysis, a proper planning and time schedule must be developed for different activities that are required to design a database system. In addition to a time schedule (deadlines) for different activities, the cost factors are also taken into consideration.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>16.</span> What is the purpose of feasibility study?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Feasibility study is conducted to investigate required database system. It determines whether the proposed system is affordable, possible, and acceptable. It also involves the identification and selection of area.</h4>
