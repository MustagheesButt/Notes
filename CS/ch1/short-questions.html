<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>1.</span> What is data?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">
		<p>Data is a collection of facts, figures and statistics related to something or someone. After processing data, it is converted to useful information.</p>

	</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>2.</span> Define data set.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">A collection of related records is called a data set or a file. A file is treated as a single unit. A collection of a college's student records will form a students file or data set.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>3.</span> What is the difference between data and information?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">
		<p>Data is a set of raw facts and figures, while information is the processed form of data. Data is used as input to the computer, and the computer, after processing, outputs information.</p>
		<p>For example, the scores of different players in a cricket match are: 23, 45, 9, 17, 94, 57, 12, 3, 15, 1. This is data.</p>
		<p>If we want something useful like the highest score, we can process the above data to find 94. This (highest score) is information.</p>
